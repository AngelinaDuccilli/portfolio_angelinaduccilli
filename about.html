            <h2>   Hello, my name is Angelina Duccilli. I am a part of the graduating class of 2020 at String Theory High School. I have always loved school and learning ever since I was old enough to start attending. Family, friends, athletics, and academics are very important aspects in my life, as well as many other things. In addition to academics being one of the most important things to me, I am also very invested in being a well-rounded person. I believe the most successful person is not one who only excels in whatever they put their mind to, such as academics and a career, but also aspires to be the best version of themselves. 


                Due to attending Philadelphia Performing Arts, String Theory Charter School since kindergarten, I have gotten the chance to experience every art they offered. Although I loved every art I have taken part in, I felt drawn to science. I have always loved the subject and fell in love with the art of forensics. To me, forensics is another way to help someone and also enjoy what I am doing. I hope to have a successful career in this field and cannot wait to explore every part of it. To find out more about me, continue browsing through this site I have created. Enjoy!</h2>
